Enforce Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow for new function creation:
1. When a new function is required, first write comprehensive tests, including edge cases.
2. Only after tests are written, proceed to implement the function.
3. Run the tests. If tests fail, iterate on the function implementation until all tests pass.
4. Once all tests pass, insert the function and its tests into the official codebase.
